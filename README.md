# Grid-based Framework
This is an attempt to create our own grid-based framework as part of completing the curriculum at [Microverse](https://microverse.org)

## Built With
- HTML
- CSS

## How to use my Custom Grid System
Simply create a wrapper element with a .row class. Place your column elements inside and give each a class of .col-{breakpoint}-{column-width}, where {breakpoint} is the size at which the grid will collapse to full-width (see Breakpoint Sizes below) and {column-width} is the number of horizontal columns that the element will occupy.
